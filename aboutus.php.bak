Technology has changed the way job seekers search for jobs and employers find qualified employees.<br>
 While employers still advertise job openings through traditional advertising mediums, such as local newspapers and magazines, today employers and job seekers turn to online job portals to find employment matches.<br>
Job seekers can advertise their skills and search for available positions, and employers can announce employment openings through job portals such as Monster, Career Builders and USA Jobs, for federal government positions.<br>
Employment portals offer community bulletin boards and forums designed to assist job seekers in their employment search. Users can connect with other seekers or potential employers by participating in forum conversations about sales, technology, the health care industry, government jobs, restaurant employment and issues affecting recent college graduates.<br>
Employment portals offer online training and educational resources to help prepare job seekers for the marketplace.<br>
 Job seekers can find courses to improve marketing or typing skills and state-specific programs to help prepare for insurance licensing exams.<br>
  To advance their education, job seekers can use employment portals to enroll in online certificate and degree programs through accredited institutions, such as The Art Institutes, University of Phoenix, Argosy University and the International Academy of Design & Technology.<br>
